# VSOLVE Website

A sophisticated, strategic website for VSOLVE India Pvt Ltd - a sacred system and precision consultancy serving global institutions, legacy businesses, and national bodies with emotionally ethical, karmically aligned strategic systems.

## Philosophy

VSOLVE is not a consulting firm. It is a sacred system designed to serve institutions, governments, and leaders who cannot afford misalignment. This website embodies that philosophy through:

- **Strategic, not promotional** - Curated intelligence space, not a marketing funnel
- **Ethically precise, not generic** - Every element serves the sacred mission
- **Karmically neutral, not inflated** - Quiet elegance without ego

## Design Principles

- **Typography**: Playfair Display (serif) for headings, Inter (sans-serif) for body
- **Aesthetic**: Minimal, elite layout with cinematic elegance

### User Experience
- Gated access approach - entry begins with introspection
- Sacred timing - no rush, no pressure
- Curated content for institutional decision-makers

## Technology Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with App Router
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system
- **Animations**: Framer Motion for elegant interactions
